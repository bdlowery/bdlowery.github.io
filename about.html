			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>
				I live in Rocklin, CA. I went to Sierra College for 2 years and then
				transferred to Sacramento State. I'll be graduating from Sac state
				in Spring 2024.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm currently working at
				<a href="https://perpetual.education/">Perpetual Education</a>. My
				current project is revamping their internal student dashboard to be
				more custom, and to give instructors more quality of life. The site
				is built with custom wordpress. The languages I'm using are PHP and
				Javascript.
			</p>
			<p>
				I co-founded a web development agency called
				<a href="https://www.unwrapdesign.com/">Unwrap Design</a>. A lot of
				small businesses have crappy websites, and can't afford to spend
				$10k on a modern, nice looking website (and most often when they do
				spend a large sum, the site still looks bad).
			</p>
			<p>
				We created an agency using a subscription model to try and solve
				this problem. Currently have 10 recurring subscriptions, and are
				working on 4 more sites.
